TODO:
- Pretty up the UI
- Find a way to make scrubbing on MKV/AVI formats work better
- Subtitles
- Search your library
- How to handle shows? 
  - The initial view is just a link to the list of episodes?
- Pick where you want the movies saved. S3, Google Drive, file server, local drive, etc.
- Search other torrent aggregators and have an instant "add to library" and "watch now" button
- In the movie view, clicking the image flips to display the metadata descripton, movie length, title, year release, etc. There is a play button in the bottom right corner (not visible when viewing metadata)
