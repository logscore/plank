TODO:
- [x] Pretty up the UI
- [ ] Find a way to make scrubbing on MKV/AVI formats work better
- [ ] Subtitles
- [x] Search your library
- [ ] How to handle shows? 
  - [ ] The initial view is just a link to the list of episodes?
  - [ ] The ui should be a context menu thats wide with a scrollable list of the episodes with a play icon to the left of each entry
- [ ] Pick where you want the movies saved. S3, Google Drive, file server, local drive, etc.
- [ ] Search other torrent aggregators and have an instant "add to library" and "watch now" button
- [x] In the movie view, clicking the image flips to display the metadata descripton, movie length, title, year release, etc. There is a play button in the bottom right corner (not visible when viewing metadata)
