# ROADMAP

- [ ] Handle no TMDB api key by having a poster placeholder
- [ ] Public website mode
  - [ ] Stream torrents on the client only. TMDB service is still provided (secures our API key), but that's it. Everything else is handled by the client. We shouldnt even use Jackett for this mode.
  - [ ] When a magnet link is added, stream it right away and store the metadata and magnet link on the browser for restreaming if they want to watch it again.
- [ ] Im noticing some mental frictin with search. I think we can try having search for the browser be on the browser page and default to its browser selection on the selection page. or something like that
- [ ] Ensure that when I add a movie or TV show to my library, the data from the torrent card gets added into the database. So that the media card in my library is the exact same as what is displayed on the browse page. 
- [ ] Improve the details cards on tv shows. they currently dont have a redownload button, dont show the mb/sec # of peers or size of torrent, and they dont show the location of the episodes, which should be where the seasons are located as it holds multiple files. I want the same functionality as the movies version of the page
- [ ] Improve the episode cards on the tv show details page. Maybe add the title, the description of the episode, runtime, and a poster image
  - [ ] Add a button to redownload just that episode
- [ ] Remove the cache tables in the db and just use tanstack query / tanstack db
- [ ] Have the download be background jobs instead of main thread processes. Use something light weight like a valkey scheduler
- [ ] Find a way to make scrubbing on MKV/AVI formats work better
- [ ] Pick where you want the movies saved. S3, Google Drive, file server, local drive, etc.
- [ ] Auto updater. Just click a button and it checks for updates and updates the app. Privileges are a massive security issue here. We should hold off on this until we have a better plan for security
- [ ] Adjust progress endpoint to SSE. Stop streaming when video plays, and start again if user opens "stats for nerds"
- [ ] The torrent index setup page isnt working since the migration to prowlerr. 
- [ ] add a setting to seed the torrents. This will be a toggle on the settings page and on signup. It will default to false.
- [ ] Subtitles
- [ ] **Content Request & Voting System (Backburner)**
  - Family/friends can request movies/shows
  - In person movie party people can request and vote on movies/shows via QR code page
  - Upvote/downvote system for content prioritization
  - Auto-download when votes reach threshold
  - Perfect for group watch parties and democratic content selection/content management for parents
  - Could integrate with "Smart Season Pass" for automated TV show management (idk what this is)
- [ ] Sonarr/Radarr-style automation
  - Auto-monitor new episodes for TV shows in library
  - Smart quality selection based on preferences
  - Release group preferences
  - Auto-download when new episodes air, notify when available via text


- [x] Migrate user manaement to organizations so admin users can add new people to access their stuff
- [x] Torrent search added to search page functionality. Specify search you library vs search the index
- [x] Try migrating to prowlerr for our torrent index search
- [x] Dont disable adding the media wen prefetching it, but do hen actively 
- [x] Search other torrent aggregators and have an instant "add to library" and "watch now" button
- [x] Search your library
  - [x] Search by title
- [x] Upload tv shows to the library
- [x] Implement a caching system for torrents. Maybe use index db or a local store (tanstack db?) so we dont hit the TMDB api so much.
  - [x] Maybe migrate to tanstack query/tanstack db
    - We used tanstack query, but tanstack db might be a fun experiment
